# Browser Games
Do you remember the good old days of playing games directly in your web browser? This repository is dedicated to preserving and showcasing classic browser games that defined an era of online entertainment. From simple flash games to complex HTML5 adventures, we aim to keep the spirit of browser gaming alive.

## How to run the games
With the game created from js (Superfighters.js) you can run it by simply opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

With the game run in flash (the file with .swf extension) you will need a flash player to run it. 
1. Run the Flash Player in this project folder.\
2. Drag and drop the .swf file into the Flash Player window.\
3. Enjoy the game!
